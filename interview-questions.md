# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: A paramenter is something we set in a function to deliniate what element were going to be working with, and arugument is the log we are passing 

Researched answer: An  Argument is a value passed to a function/method. A parameter ia a varibale that is defined in a method/function declaration. Parameters are placeholder values, and the arguments is the actual values that will be used by the method/function to do the programmed task.

2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

Your answer:  I believe it holds the current value, the array and the index. The only required value is the current value being used for the array.

Researched answer:.map has three values it can take in which is the current value in the array, index which is the index of the element in the array, and the array which is the array being used by the .map. The only one required is the current value being used. 

3. What is the difference between map and filter?

Your answer:.map will return an array of the same lenght while .filter filters out elements within the array based on the logic given.

Researched answer: I was wrong because they are simliar since they both return new arrays. Filter only displays the elements in the array that pass a specified condition. Map changes all the elemts in the array using the callback fucntion.

Researched answer: I was corect, the Iteration is going to t=be the process of running and repeating a sequence a specified amount of times. Its purpose is to easily perform repetetive tasks. 

5. What is the difference between a function and a method?

Your answer: A built in method is an existing line of code that has a specific function it does. A function is a structure that we can add logic to and get it to perform a specific task or tasks.
